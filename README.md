PHP Modular Web Application Case Study

## Our Goal

Building modular PHP web application framework. What do we mean by `modular design` is as written in [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design):

> Modular design, or "modularity in design", is a design approach that subdivides a system into smaller parts called modules or skids, that can be independently created and then used in different systems. A modular system can be characterized by functional partitioning into discrete scalable, reusable modules, rigorous use of well-defined modular interfaces, and making use of industry standards for interfaces.

We are working hard to build this framework so that we can build a web-based software product line using PHP. yeah, that the main goal but for now we are just aiming to build a lightweight PHP web application framework using this case study.
